    * Parent id existence is checked by Media Server - only once for this operation. 
    * Database transaction is committed each 11 objects created into database. 
    * This empirical value is hard coded in current implementation. 
    * If an execution of task fails when creating object (e.g. 776-th item on list) 
    * error code is retuned (aExecStatus), which points to last successfully created item index [1...total count] 
    * (e.g. aExecutionStatus = 770 last item in database is object number 770, 
    * if no object is cretated index = 0, if all are created index = total count).
    *
    * Note: There is no support for chunked operations (splitting long operation 
    * into sequence of asynchronical calls). Each operation is atomic from 
    * Media Server Engine perspective. Long lasting operations may block Media Server Engine. 
    * In such case switching Media Server to offline mode is recommended.
    *

    * - "res" element value
